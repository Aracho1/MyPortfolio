4. Split Battle project into lib/spec/views folders and keep separate. [Repo here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk3-battle). The model here are Ruby classes that are being called by the controller (app.rb), which defines what happens on each page of the web app. The view is the files contained in the views folder, containing what is displayed in the browser when it's called.
