# Weeks 8/9

## Weekly Goals

1. Can you use high-quality processes to build a project in a team?
2. [Project Criteria](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/final_projects/project_criteria.md) must be met

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Strictly follow project criteria. Continue to focus on process/TDD/understanding over completion.
2. Be strict with process! Keep this open at all times. Maybe write blog post about process?

#### Evidence:

1. Followed strict TDD process, using Travis CI and branch merge rules to protect master. [Repo here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/acebook-rails-template-railz-rude-boiz) with Travis CI passing for all completed merges
2. 
- Write a [goals/planning based wiki](https://github.com/DanGyi23/acebook-rails-template-railz-rude-boiz/blob/master/Learning-WIKI/Railz-Rude-Boiz-Wiki.md) to do with our learnings. I also wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@daniel.gyi/integrating-active-storage-with-your-existing-devise-framework-rails-bf9fc65a43c1)!
- Recorded screencaps after week1 vs week2 to show progress w.r.t. feature implementation. [Week1](https://github.com/DanGyi23/MyPortfolio/blob/master/videos/Functionality-end-of-week-1.mov)
