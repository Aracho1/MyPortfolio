# Week 4

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Build Bookmark Manager and Chitter App
2. Practise debugging using capybara/sinatra test frameworks
3. Create planning docs with each of my repos before any code written, understand the relational database and how it can be used.

#### Evidence:

1. [Bookmark Manager](https://github.com/DanGyi23/bookmark_manage) and [Chitter App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/chitter-challenge)
2. Had to debug lots using Capybara, didn't record any of it though.
3. Example of a [few planning images](https://github.com/DanGyi23/chitter-challenge/tree/master/planning/images) so that writing tests was easy. Found it very useful!

## Daily Goals

#### Monday 9th September
- GOAL: Understand SQL a little better
- PLAN: Read up about databases/SQL
- EVIDENCE: [Completed SQLZoo tests](https://sqlzoo.net/)

#### Tuesday 10th September
- GOAL: Understand the Ruby/Database relationships in weekly code
- PLAN: Ducktype every line of code in my weekly project
- EVIDENCE: None

#### Wednesday 11th September
- GOAL: Confirm understanding of database-model layer relationship
- PLAN: Draw database/model diagrams to demonstrate understanding of how DBs interact with model layer of web apps
- EVIDENCE: A couple of simple domain models [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/bookmark-mgr/tree/master/domain_models)

#### Thursday 12th September
- GOAL: Understand one-to-many database relationships, using SQL
- PLAN: Implement comments in Bookmark Manager (many comments to one bookmark)
- EVIDENCE: Comments implemented [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/bookmark_manage) - new class with new database and relational database

#### Friday 13th September
- GOAL: Understand many-to-many database relationships, using SQL
- PLAN: Implement tags in Bookmark Manager (many tags to many bookmarks)
- EVIDENCE: Tags implemented [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/bookmark_manage)

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

Yes, but it took the weekend challenge to really cement my learning. I found using SQL to be quite clunky and difficult to use.

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

I'd do extra reading before moving on to another step of a challenge, to make sure I understand fully the theory behind some of the more complex code I'm writing.
I also need to meditate more and take more breaks! I've downloaded Marinara so that I can focus better and feel better towards the end of the day.
