# Week 4

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Build Bookmark Manager and Chitter App
2. Practise debugging using capybara/sinatra test frameworks
3. Create planning docs with each of my repos before any code written, understand the relational database and how it can be used.

#### Evidence:

1. [Bookmark Manager](https://github.com/DanGyi23/bookmark_manage) and [Chitter App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/chitter-challenge)
2. Had to debug lots using Capybara, didn't record any of it though.
3. Example of a [few planning images](https://github.com/DanGyi23/chitter-challenge/tree/master/planning/images) so that writing tests was easy. Found it very useful!
