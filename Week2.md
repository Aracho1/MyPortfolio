# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Continue using strict TDD process, which involves understanding of OOP, testing etc. Continue to request feedback for pairing, improving each day
2. Use Oyster Card challenge as opportunity to split and refactor classes (e.g. Card class methods moved into Journey class)
3. When refactoring classes, use RSpec mocking to eliminate cross-class dependencies when testing, making sure unit tests are isolated
4. Complete all OO practicals set in the week2 of week_outlines
5. Go through peer code review and complete Google Form for airport challenge

3. Oyster card challenge demonstrates this really well; individual class spec files reference only the subject or mocked classes.*INSERT LINK*
