# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn some basic TDD best practices
2. Debug some programs with errors - follow best practices
3. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
4. Pair using the driver-navigator style

#### Plans to achieve:
1. Work through the Boris Bike Challenge and attend workshop
2. Debug 2 Ruby programs that have multiple syntax and testing errors
3. Work through OO exercises in the course week outline, and read documentation on Class, since that's an area of weak understanding that I've identified.
4.

#### Evidence:
1. Exhaustive step-wise Boris Bike challenge [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/boris_bike_challenge) - commits demonstrate different stages of unit & feature testing. Completed as part of a pair.
2. Screencaps [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/MyPortfolio/blob/master/videos/wk1-debug-cipher.mp4) and [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/MyPortfolio/blob/master/videos/wk1-debug-fizzbuzz.mp4)

## Daily Goals

#### Tuesday 20th August
- GOAL: To be able to debug something
- PLAN: Work through the debugging exercises - Fizzbuzz and Decoder
- EVIDENCE: Screencap videos as above - both debugged. Would like to clean up nilclass exceptions if I have more time, but not crucial.

#### Wednesday 21st August
- GOAL: Understand some basic principles of OO programming - encapsulation and SRP
- PLAN: Use the morning to work through OO exercises, perhaps recording progress.
- EVIDENCE: OOP repo in skills repository - updated with completed commit [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/oop_1). Created instance of class and tested in IRB [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/skills-workshops/blob/master/week-1/oop_1/IRB-test-Calc-Class.png)
