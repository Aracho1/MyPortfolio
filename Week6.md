# Week 6

## Weekly Goals

1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
2. Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives
4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
5. Give and receive meaningful code review

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Use Trello and timeboxing to achieve
2. Split into user stories, put them on our README, and select those ONLY that will deliver the MVP, after which we can focus on different features as a matter of priority.
3. Book in morning and afternoon 10 mins to work through and make sure we're aligned
4. Follow SRP for all aspects of our code, so even though we'll be working on different branches, modules should work independently and there shouldn't be git merge conflicts.
5. Review each others code each morning so that we can both understand how different modules communicate, and give feedback on ease of reading/elegance etc.

#### Evidence:

1. [Trello!](https://github.com/DanGyi23/MyPortfolio/blob/master/SS-Trello.png)
2. [README](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk6-MakersBnB) We wrote a thorough README with domain modelling and user stories. We wanted to make sure that we were thorough with our planning. We decided intially to figure out the REST structure, including params and endpoints. That way we could build the client and server side simultaneously.
3. None, but we did!
4. [Lots of branches/merges etc.](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk6-MakersBnB)
5. None, but we did!


## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Yes, I was really pleased with the App, despite only having a few of us working on it. I spent a lot of time getting SQL errors because of large DB demands, which meant timeouts were frequent in the browser. I wanted to challenge myself to build a really nice front-end with JQuery and CSS/HTML, and that worked brilliantly. It was responsive too!
- If we'd have had a larger team, we'd likely have managed to build a lot more features, but for the time we had, the 'product' was really excellent.
- I really, really enjoyed working in a team on a single project, rather than in pairs for the afternoon.

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

**Personal:**
- Try not to finish everything - there's too much to complete and my learning was compromised at times by being too concerned with completion rather than the process
- Spend more time understanding a problem/feature before starting to write code. I found that it meant I had to refactor less, and interdependencies were easier to map out
